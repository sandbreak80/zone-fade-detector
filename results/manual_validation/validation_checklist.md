# Zone Fade Entry Points Validation Checklist

Use this checklist to manually validate each entry point detected by the Zone Fade Detector.

## 📋 Entry Point Validation Checklist

### Basic Information

- [ ] **Spike Timing**: Verify volume spike coincides with rejection
- [ ] **Volume Pattern**: Assess if volume pattern supports reversal
- [ ] **Volume Context**: Check for any manipulation signs

### Zone Quality Assessment
- [ ] **Zone Significance**: Verify zone level is significant (HTF)
- [ ] **Zone Type**: Confirm zone type matches market context
- [ ] **Prior Touches**: Check for prior touches of the zone
- [ ] **Zone Strength**: Assess zone strength and quality

### Entry Window Analysis
- [ ] **Window Duration**: Note how long entry window lasted
- [ ] **Price Bounds**: Check if price stayed within zone bounds

### Quality Rating
- [ ] **QRS Score**: Record the QRS score (0-10)
- [ ] **Overall Quality**: Rate overall setup quality (1-5)
- [ ] **Execution Feasibility**: Rate execution feasibility (1-5)
- [ ] **Risk Assessment**: Rate risk level (1-5)

## 📊 Validation Scoring

### Rejection Candle Score (0-4 points)

- **2 points**: Moderate rejection with some issues
- **1 point**: Weak rejection with significant issues
- **0 points**: No clear rejection pattern

### Volume Analysis Score (0-3 points)
- **3 points**: Strong volume spike (2.5x+) with good timing
- **2 points**: Moderate volume spike (1.8-2.5x) with good timing
- **1 point**: Weak volume spike (1.5-1.8x) or poor timing
- **0 points**: No volume spike or poor timing

### Zone Quality Score (0-3 points)
- **3 points**: High-quality zone with prior touches and significance
- **2 points**: Good zone quality with some prior touches
- **1 point**: Moderate zone quality with limited history
- **0 points**: Poor zone quality or no prior touches

### Entry Window Score (0-3 points)
- **3 points**: Long window (20+ min) with clear opportunity
- **2 points**: Adequate window (10-20 min) with good opportunity
- **1 point**: Short window (5-10 min) with limited opportunity
- **0 points**: Very short window (<5 min) or no opportunity

### Market Context Score (0-2 points)
- **2 points**: Excellent market context for fading
- **1 point**: Good market context with some concerns
- **0 points**: Poor market context or unfavorable conditions

## 🎯 Quality Assessment

### Excellent Entry Points (15-18 points)
- Perfect rejection candle with clear wick

### Good Entry Points (10-14 points)
- Good rejection candle with adequate wick
- Moderate volume spike (1.8-2.5x) with good timing
- Decent zone quality with some history
- Adequate entry window (10+ minutes)
- Good market context

### Fair Entry Points (5-9 points)
- Moderate rejection candle with some issues
- Weak volume spike (1.5-1.8x) or poor timing
- Moderate zone quality with limited history
- Short entry window (5-10 minutes)
- Fair market context

### Poor Entry Points (0-4 points)
- Weak rejection candle or unclear pattern
- No volume spike or very poor timing
- Poor zone quality or no history
- Very short window (<5 minutes)
- Poor market context

## 📈 Validation Summary

### Overall Assessment

## 🔍 Common Issues to Watch For

### False Positives
- Weak rejection candles that don't show clear reversal
- Volume spikes that don't align with rejection
- Poor zone quality with no prior significance
- Short entry windows with immediate invalidation

### False Negatives
- Good setups that don't meet strict criteria
- Valid rejections with lower volume spikes
- Quality zones that don't meet HTF requirements
- Good opportunities with shorter windows

### Parameter Sensitivity
- Wick ratio threshold (30% may be too strict)
- Volume spike threshold (1.8x may be too high)
- QRS threshold (7.0 may be too selective)
- Zone quality requirements (may be too strict)
