Here’s a distilled, ready-to-use playbook from the transcript you pasted (plus the linked repo). I’ve kept it practical so you can drop it into your own workflow.

# TL;DR (what to keep)

* Use **bar-level returns** (not trade-level) and compute objectives (Profit Factor, Sharpe) on those—more samples → more stable metrics.
* Validate in **four stages**:

  1. In-sample excellence → 2) In-sample Monte-Carlo permutation test → 3) Walk-forward test → 4) Walk-forward permutation test.
* Treat out-of-sample years as scarce; use permutation tests to avoid “spending” your OOS too early. The mcpt repo implements these ideas. ([GitHub][1])

# Core methodology

## 0) Data + returns model

* Build a **position signal per bar**: `1` long, `0` flat, `-1` short.
* Compute **close-to-close returns**, **shift forward 1 bar**, and multiply by the position signal → **bar-level strategy returns**.
* Use these returns for objectives (Profit Factor, Sharpe), drawdowns, and histograms (stability check).

**Why bar returns?** More observations than trade-level → lower variance, more reliable objective estimates (matches the rationale behind mcpt usage and Masters’ guidance on Monte-Carlo tests). ([GitHub][1])

## 1) In-sample excellence (development loop)

* Pick a candidate strategy (the video demo uses a Donchian/Donchian-like breakout with lookback optimization).
* Optimize **within a fixed train window**; grid search is fine for simple params.
* Inspect:

  * **Is it excellent?** For its class, does the equity line and objective look meaningfully strong?
  * **Is it obviously overfit?** Suspect signals: near-perfect win rate, extreme smoothness, or any future leak.

**Tip:** If the equity is inconsistent, drill down by regime (volatility, trend, time-of-day) to locate failure modes, then iterate.

## 2) In-sample Monte-Carlo permutation test (IMCPT)

**Goal:** Ask, “Could our in-sample excellence be just selection bias/noise?”

**Concept:** Permute price bars to **destroy genuine temporal structure** while preserving first-order distributional stats (mean/std/skew/kurtosis; overall start/end level), then **re-optimize** on each permutation and compare objective to the real data. If the real optimized score beats most permutations → evidence that patterns, not just mining, drove the result.

**Practical recipe:**

* Generate **N permutations** of the in-sample period (N≈1,000 preferred; 100 is a hard minimum only if runtime is painful).
* On each permuted series: repeat the same **optimization** and compute the best objective.
* Compute **p-value ≈ (#permutations ≥ real optimized score) / N**.
* **Heuristic cutoffs from the transcript:** aim **p < 1%** to “pass” in-sample. (Treat as a guide, not a target—don’t tune to the test.)

**Notes:** Bar-permutation preserves many but not all properties (e.g., it breaks volatility clustering/long memory). If your edge relies on those, IMCPT can be optimistic—so passing still doesn’t guarantee robustness. ([GitHub][1])

## 3) Walk-forward test (WFT)

* **Rolling retrain**: choose train window (e.g., 4 years of hourly data) and **re-optimize on a schedule** (e.g., every 30 days).
* Concatenate walk-forward signals on the **never-seen** subsequent bars to get true OOS performance.
* Expect performance to degrade vs. in-sample (no optimization bias).
* Decide: “Is this tradable for me?” (subjective thresholds; consider PF, Sharpe, drawdown, turnover, capacity, slippage).

## 4) Walk-forward permutation test (WFPT)

**Goal:** Ask, “Could my walk-forward result happen by dumb luck from a worthless strategy?”

**Concept:** Keep the first training fold **unpermuted**, **permute only the OOS horizon(s)**, then run the exact walk-forward pipeline on each permutation. If your real WFT score beats most permuted-world scores, you likely captured recurring structure.

**Practical recipe:**

* For each of **M permutations** (often fewer than IMCPT because runtime explodes; e.g., M≈200):

  * Permute **after** the first training fold (keep training data intact).
  * Run the **same** walk-forward retraining schedule and compute objective.
* Compute **p-value** as above.
* **Heuristic from transcript:** for a **single OOS year**, accept around **p ≤ 5%** (lenient). For **2+ OOS years**, target **p ≤ 1%**.
* If p is high (e.g., 22% in their Donchian example), assume your OOS success might be luck → iterate again.

These tests align with the approach described in Masters’ *Permutation and Randomization Tests for Trading System Development* and the mcpt project that operationalizes them. ([Google Books][2])

# Implementation blueprint (drop-in)

## Data & objective

* **Inputs:** OHLCV with uniform bars; transaction cost model; slippage model (at least a haircut).
* **Signal:** vector of {−1, 0, +1}.
* **Returns:** `r_bar = signal.shift(1) * close.pct_change()` (or log returns).
* **Objectives:** Profit Factor (PF), Sharpe, max DD, MAR, hit-rate; prefer PF + DD for breakout/trend logic.
* **Stability checks:** bootstrap objective CI; per-regime summaries; monthly heatmap.

## Permutation engine (essentials)

* Preserve first/last price and distributional stats; **shuffle intra-bar relatives** and **gaps** separately; reconstruct OHLC path; support **multi-market** with aligned indices to preserve cross-asset correlation. (Exactly what mcpt aims to do.) ([GitHub][1])

## Controls & thresholds (from the transcript, use as guides)

* IMCPT: **N≈1,000** permutations preferred; **pass if p < ~1%**.
* WFPT: **M≈200** often practical; **≤5%** for 1 OOS year, **≤1%** for 2+ years.
* If runtime is prohibitive: profile and speed up (vectorize, numba, PyPy, or prune parameter grid) before lowering N/M.

## Walk-forward setup

* **Train window:** pick a history length that spans multiple regimes (e.g., 3–5y on hourly/4h for crypto; adapt to instrument).
* **Retrain cadence:** as often as feasible (days→weeks), consistent with live ops.
* **Selection hygiene:** Do **not** keep reusing the same OOS span to pick among many ideas—this creates **validation selection bias**.

# Best practices & guardrails

**What to always do**

* Use **bar-level** returns, not just trade PnL.
* **Fix leaks**: no look-ahead, signal lagged by 1 bar, use only known info at bar close.
* **Model frugality**: prefer simple strategies; if complexity rises, regularize and expect stricter p-values.
* **Cost realism**: include fees, spreads, slip; test sensitivity.
* **Multiple objectives**: PF + DD, Sharpe, turnover; ensure no single metric drives all choices.
* **Discipline**: Treat the p-values as **measures**, not targets; don’t tune to “just pass”.

**What to avoid**

* Using the same OOS year across many ideas → **validation set becomes in-sample by selection**.
* Declaring victory from a single hot year; aggregate across instruments/years.
* Over-reliance on permutation tests when your edge **is** volatility clustering/long-memory—augment with regime-aware tests.

# Concrete test framework (step-by-step)

1. **Define strategy**

   * Params, entry/exit rules, position sizing = 1x notional (keep sizing simple first).

2. **Build bar-return engine**

   * Position signal → shifted returns → objective computation.

3. **In-sample optimize**

   * Modest grid/random search; record **full trace** (param → objective) for flatness analysis.

4. **IMCPT**

   * Generate N permutations of **training window**.
   * For each: re-optimize identically; store best objective.
   * Compute p-value; histogram; sanity-check bell shape.

5. **Walk-forward**

   * Rolling 4y train, 30-day retrain (example cadence), create unified OOS return series.
   * Evaluate OOS objectives; compare to in-sample.

6. **WFPT**

   * Permute **only OOS windows** for M runs; re-run the WF pipeline each time.
   * Compute p-value; histogram.

7. **Decision**

   * If **both** IMCPT and WFPT show **low p-values** and OOS metrics clear your bar → candidate for live paper-trade.
   * Else → iterate: simplify rules, change features, stabilize lookbacks, or abandon.

8. **Pre-production**

   * Transaction-cost stress tests; slippage shocks; capacity checks; latency tolerance.
   * Multi-asset cross-validation if the logic claims generality.

# Pseudocode (minimal)

```python
# 1) bar returns
signal = strategy_signal(ohlc, params)           # {-1,0,1} per bar
ret = ohlc.close.pct_change().shift(-1)
strat_ret = signal * ret

# 2) objective
def profit_factor(returns):
    gains = returns[returns > 0].sum()
    losses = -returns[returns < 0].sum()
    return gains / max(losses, 1e-12)

# 3) IMCPT
best_real = optimize_strategy(ohlc, objective=profit_factor)
scores_perm = []
for _ in range(N):
    ohlc_p = permute_bars(ohlc)                  # preserve first/last + distrib’n
    best_p = optimize_strategy(ohlc_p, objective=profit_factor)
    scores_perm.append(best_p)
p_in = (np.sum(np.array(scores_perm) >= best_real) / N)

# 4) Walk-forward
wf_signal = walk_forward_signal(ohlc, train_years=4, retrain_days=30)
wf_pf = profit_factor(wf_signal.shift(1) * ret)

# 5) WFPT
scores_wfperm = []
for _ in range(M):
    ohlc_p = permute_bars(ohlc, start_index=first_OOS_idx)  # train intact
    wf_sig_p = walk_forward_signal(ohlc_p, train_years=4, retrain_days=30)
    scores_wfperm.append(profit_factor(wf_sig_p.shift(1) * ret_from(ohlc_p)))
p_wf = (np.sum(np.array(scores_wfperm) >= wf_pf) / M)
```

# Practical acceptance bar (suggested)

* **IMCPT:** p < **1%** (ideally much lower) with **N ≥ 1,000** permutations.
* **WFPT:**

  * One OOS year: p ≤ **5%** acceptable;
  * Multiple OOS years: p ≤ **1%**;
  * Prefer M ≥ **200** permutations (or more, budget allowing).
* **Metrics:** PF > 1.2–1.4 net costs for trend/BO in liquid markets, or a Sharpe that clears your execution and capital costs with headroom.

---

# Common pitfalls (and fixes)

* **Future leak via unshifted returns** → always shift returns by one bar relative to signal.
* **Optimizing to the test** (p-hacking) → lock the framework, run once per iteration, and keep an experiment log.
* **Permutation engine mismatch** → if your edge is volatility-structure dependent, complement IMCPT/WFPT with regime-aware sims (e.g., block bootstraps, HMM regime resampling).
* **Over-fitting lookbacks** → prefer **stable plateaus**: choose a reasonable lookback from a wide plateau and hold it fixed; improve logic around it rather than re-tuning every month.
