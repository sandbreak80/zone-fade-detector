# Entry Point Logic Update

## üéØ **Overview**

The entry point detection logic has been updated to include **risk/reward filtering** and **corrected window duration tracking**. This ensures only high-quality trading setups are identified.

## üîÑ **Key Changes**

### 1. **Risk/Reward Filtering**
- **NEW**: Only accepts entry points with 1:2 or better risk/reward ratio
- **Purpose**: Ensures profitable trading opportunities
- **Implementation**: Calculates stop loss and take profit levels for each setup

### 2. **Corrected Window Duration Tracking**
- **FIXED**: Tracks how long entry conditions remain valid (not just zone proximity)
- **Purpose**: Provides accurate execution time assessment
- **Implementation**: Checks ALL entry conditions every minute until invalid

## üìä **Entry Point Criteria**

An entry point is now identified ONLY when ALL conditions are met:

### **Basic Conditions**
1. ‚úÖ Zone is being touched
2. ‚úÖ Rejection candle pattern (30% wick ratio)
3. ‚úÖ Volume spike (1.8x average)
4. ‚úÖ QRS score ‚â• 7.0

### **NEW: Risk/Reward Filtering**
5. ‚úÖ Risk/reward ratio ‚â• 2.0 (1:2 or better)

## üí∞ **Risk/Reward Calculation**

### **Short Trades** (Supply Zones)
- **Entry**: Above zone level
- **Stop Loss**: 1% above zone level
- **Take Profit**: 2% below zone level
- **Risk/Reward**: (Entry - Take Profit) / (Stop Loss - Entry)

### **Long Trades** (Demand Zones)
- **Entry**: Below zone level
- **Stop Loss**: 1% below zone level
- **Take Profit**: 2% above zone level
- **Risk/Reward**: (Take Profit - Entry) / (Entry - Stop Loss)

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Window Duration Tracking**

### **Original Logic (INCORRECT)**
- Stops when price moves away from zone
- Measures zone proximity, not trading opportunity
- May overestimate execution time

### **Corrected Logic (ACCURATE)**
- Tracks how long entry conditions remain valid
- Checks ALL conditions every minute:
  - Zone still being touched?
  - Still rejection candle pattern?
  - Still volume spike?
  - QRS score still ‚â• 7?
- Stops when ANY condition is no longer met
- Reports actual trading opportunity window

## üìà **Expected Results**

### **Entry Point Count**
- **Before**: Many entry points (including low-quality setups)
- **After**: Fewer but higher-quality entry points (1:2+ R/R only)

### **Window Duration**
- **Before**: 28.9 minutes average (overestimated)
- **After**: 1-5 minutes average (realistic)

### **Trading Quality**
- **Before**: Mixed quality setups
- **After**: Only profitable setups with proper risk management

## üöÄ **Usage**

### **Run Full 2024 Backtest**
```bash
# Using Docker (recommended)
docker-compose run --rm zone-fade-detector-test python backtesting/run_full_2024_backtest.py

# Or run the script directly
python backtesting/backtest_2024_corrected_window_tracking.py
```

### **Output Files**
- `results/2024/corrected/zone_fade_entry_points_2024_corrected.csv`
- `results/2024/corrected/corrected_backtesting_summary.txt`

## üìã **CSV Columns**

The output CSV now includes these additional columns:
- `direction`: LONG or SHORT
- `stop_loss`: Stop loss price level
- `take_profit`: Take profit price level
- `risk_amount`: Dollar amount at risk
- `reward_amount`: Dollar amount of potential reward
- `risk_reward_ratio`: Risk/reward ratio (‚â• 2.0)

## ‚úÖ **Benefits**

1. **Higher Quality Setups**: Only 1:2+ risk/reward setups
2. **Accurate Execution Time**: Realistic window duration assessment
3. **Better Risk Management**: Clear stop loss and take profit levels
4. **Improved Performance**: Fewer but better trading opportunities
5. **Realistic Expectations**: Accurate timeframes for trade execution

## üîç **Validation**

After running the backtest, validate the results by:
1. Checking that all `risk_reward_ratio` values are ‚â• 2.0
2. Verifying that `entry_duration_minutes` values are realistic (1-5 minutes)
3. Confirming that `entry_conditions_valid` reflects actual trading opportunity
4. Reviewing stop loss and take profit levels for reasonableness

## üìä **Performance Impact**

- **Processing Time**: Slightly longer due to risk/reward calculations
- **Entry Point Count**: Significantly reduced (quality over quantity)
- **Trading Performance**: Expected to improve due to better filtering
- **Risk Management**: Enhanced with clear stop/target levels

This update ensures that only the highest-quality trading setups are identified, with accurate execution timeframes and proper risk management parameters.
