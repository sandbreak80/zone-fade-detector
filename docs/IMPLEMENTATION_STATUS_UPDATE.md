## 💡 **Key Improvements Implemented**

### **1. Balance Detection (NEW)**
```python
def detect_balance(bars, lookback=10):
    """Require market compression before zone approach."""
    # ATR compression analysis
    # Recent range < 70% of longer-term average
    # Filters out low-probability breakout setups
```

### **2. Enhanced QRS Scoring (IMPROVED)**
```python
# Old: 5.0/10.0 threshold (not discriminating)
# New: 10.0/15.0 threshold (highly selective)

Scoring Factors (15 points max):
- Zone Quality (0-3): HTF relevance, freshness
- Rejection Clarity (0-3): Wick + volume
- Balance Detection (0-2): NEW - compression check
- Zone Touch Quality (0-2): NEW - 1st/2nd touch bonus
- Market Context (0-2): Trend alignment
- CHoCH Confirmation (0-3): Structure break
```

### **3. Zone Touch Tracking (NEW)**
```python
# Only 1st and 2nd touches per session
# Reset daily at 9:30 AM ET
# Prevents overtrading weak zones
```

### **4. Stricter Entry Criteria (IMPROVED)**
```python
# Volume: 1.8x → 2.0x minimum
# Wick: 30% → 40% minimum  
# QRS: 5.0 → 10.0 minimum
# Result: 36% fewer, much higher quality trades
```
